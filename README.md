# Leetcode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various problems on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/prachianand321/), organized by problem categories. Each folder includes my solution to a given problem, with detailed explanations and code in the respective programming languages.

### Points to Remember:
- The solutions are implemented **without** the use of any extra libraries that are already integrated into the backend.
- For each problem, I focus on the **optimal solution** with respect to time and space complexity.
- I aim to **minimize unnecessary imports** and use built-in libraries only when absolutely necessary.
- You can also track my Leetcode progress on my [Leetcode profile](https://leetcode.com/u/prachianand321/).
